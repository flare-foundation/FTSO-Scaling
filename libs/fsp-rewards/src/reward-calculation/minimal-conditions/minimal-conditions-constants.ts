// FTSO anchor feeds: Providers must submit a value estimate that lies within a 0.5% band around the consensus median value in 80% 
// of voting rounds within a reward epoch.
// 
// FTSO block-latency feeds: Providers must submit at least 80% of their expected number of updates within a reward epoch, 
// unless they have very low weight, defined as < 0.2% of the total active weight.
//
// Staking: Providers must meet 80% total uptime in the reward epoch with at least 1M FLR in active self-bond. 
// However, in order to earn passes, the provider must have at least 3M FLR in active self-bond and 15M in active stake. 
// Providers with 80% total uptime and at least 1M FLR in active self-bond but not meeting both the 3M FLR active self-bond 
// and 15M active stake requirements neither earn nor lose passes, and still receive eligible rewards.
//
// FDC: Successful participation in 60% of all voting rounds in that reward epoch.
